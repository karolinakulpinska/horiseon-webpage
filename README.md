# Horiseon Webpage - Code Refactored

## Description

Businesses increasingly consider web accessibility when developing their websites. Providing assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards, has an array of benefits: it makes a website available to people with disabilities (a disabled person's inability to access a company's website could also lead to litigation); as well as it helps to improve website's position in search engines like Google; just to name a few.

In the front-end and junior development world, one of the most common tasks is refactoring existing code to meet standards or to implement new technologies.

This week, my job was to improve the Horiseon website's accesibility by rewriting the code so that:
* semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code;
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning;
* links all function correctly;
* CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized;
* CSS and HTML files are properly commented;
* image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes;
* heading attributes fall in sequential order;
* title elements contain a concise, descriptive title;
* repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages as well as a quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

I've also made sure that the application:
* loads with no errors;
* resembles mockup image as close as possible;
* follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions as well as class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
